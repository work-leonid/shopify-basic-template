          The app is very simple to set up and enable. There are clear
          step-by-step instructions along with videos and articles to help. The
          price per month is a good value. Support, when necessary, is quick,
          efficient, and happy to help. Thank you.

          We use this app to update all page functionality. Very simple to
          understand and will have support if it's needed. Recommended giving it
          a try out if you want to update your store for good without
          compromising your budget. Thank you!

        <Testimonial>
          Got this app a couple months ago and it was fairly intuitive to
          configure and get the necessary sitemaps published as I recall. Good
          instructions and videos on how to configure. Then of course other
          things become priority and I never really got back to finalizing
          settings and dialing the app in. So it was really nice that Anthony
          reached out to me out of the blue to offer support on tweaking some
          things to better optimize the app to help my site. Now that is some
          impressive support, to be offered support when you didn't even ask for
          it. It's good to know that I am all set in this particular area of
          site management. Thank you for your review. We strive to provide
          customer support as it's our most important aspect of the app, to make
          sure you get the support you need and we're always here to provide it.
